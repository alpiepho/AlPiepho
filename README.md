### My Lists

I am a list person.  There, I have admitted it.

- Recently I have been creating utilites to auto generate my various lists: list of Github Repos,
list of Podcasts I follow, list of various online courses I've taken, etc.

- I also love figuring out automation, like CI/CD tools (Jenkins, Selenium, Puppeteer), and just found Github Actions and the new Github special repos,
like this one.

- The lists below are now generated automatically using GH Actions.

- More will be added.

- I generate these for my own reference, but if you found my Github account, I hope you will take a look.
